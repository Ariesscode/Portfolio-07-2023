# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Task
As a website developer,
I am requested to build a portfolio with no starter code. My task is to use flexbox as a base to organize my structure for styling my portfolio.




## Website Description

Given a task to meet client request of building a portfolio using the flexbox model.
When the user access the  portfolio, there will be a current photo of myself with a short description about me.
When user clicks navigation links, it will guide and scroll to matching section to make it easier and more accessible to user.
Each image has "alt" text to make the page more accessible.
When user clicks on  the work button from the navigation bar, 
there will be clickable images of my work, first one being my previous app work. 
When user clicks my previous work, they will then be sent to that app address. 
When user scrolls to my contact information, there they will have clickable links and also
a "github" link to my profile in github. It will send them to the gihub address.
User will see semantic elements and divs used to fill extra sections added to the portfoli, such as resume that will be uploaded soon. Challeneges that I have faced were the flexbox properties and getting the sizing of my containers to adjust to any screen viewport. I will in the future practice and get extra guidance on this model. Also, I am going to continue to work on this project, make changes and upload my final project to insert my solutions to issues I had to build this portfolio using flexbox model.


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
