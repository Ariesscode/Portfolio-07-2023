            <p>Welcome to my profile! This is just the beginning of my journey to becoming
                a Full Stack Web Engineer. You will get to see the most recent projects that are published and
                and projects that I am currently working on. Take some time to check out my first 
                deployed app, "Horiseon Solutions", here in my work area! My goal is to become a 
                freelance web app engineer and also teach others the knowledge, skills, tips and challenges
                that I have experienced.
